# Technology Risk Programs

Technology risk includes cybersecurity risk, but it is much wider in scope than that.  Cybersecurity is about protecting oneself from attack - essentially the equivalent of making sure no one steals your data, and no one gets into your network unauthorized.

Technology risk however is more extensive in scope than just cybersecurity.  It includes the controls that need to be in place to protect against the entire range of technology failures - from ensuring adequate capacity, to managing against outages, and making sure planned changes go in smoothly.
