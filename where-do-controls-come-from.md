# Where do controls come from?

As mentioned earlier, enterprises use controls to manage risks. Which is not very different from how we manage our personal risks, for example, the sensors on your garage door act as a control to make sure the door doesn’t drop on someone’s head.

The one difference though is that while you may not have a documented catalog of controls you have in place in your household, organizations tend to document and formalize the controls they have implemented. This is needed for several reasons. As people in corporations move around, it is important to have institutional knowledge of the risk management measures in place. Also, regulators and auditors have an expectation that the organization has a clear idea of the controls it operates.

A key part of the technology risk for organization comes from their dependence on applications.
